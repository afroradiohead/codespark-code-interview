# Codespark Coding Interview
[View the Application](https://codespark-coding-interview.herokuapp.com);
## Built with
* Frontend - [React](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
* Backend - [Nestjs](https://github.com/nestjs/nest)
* Database - [Mongo](https://www.mongodb.com/)
* Hosting - [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps)


## Time Taken to build
Total Time: 10.5 hours

## Design Decisions
### Why Nestjs?
1. Typescript adds amazing safety and functionality to javascript
2. The two most popular frontend frameworks (angular, react) are typescript friendly which opens the possibility to share interfaces between both backend and frontend applications.


### Why Heroku?
1. Very easy to set up and absolutely free. AWS costs pennies sometimes but it still costs.


# What would be left to do
1. Creating a common folder to hold interfaces for both frontend and backend Requests/Responses
2. Use SASS for the css compilation
3. Host on AWS Beanstalk
4. Tidy up the frontend code
5. Add a few functional tests
